// GLOBALS -> there is the global variable that keeps being referenced;
    seems "dangerous" to make use of it; otherwise, it's probably more of a "thread-global data" thing ?

__dirname -> path to current directory
+ __filename -> current file's name
=> __dirname + __filename

require, import (?)
    does require fail and cause a crash / throw an error ?
    => try { require("bla, non-existent"); }.catch() {}
module => object with meta-data about the current module -> isn't a module always in a file's scope ?

process => the execution environment of the node.js interpreter; this can be RAM, temp, OS, versions of node or system, maybe timing, maybe filesystem, maybe ??

built-in modules or 3rd party modules
=> "no dot": node_modules
=> "with dot, relative path" => in the project

----
module.exports is an object; using that
    import { unpack } from "./bla";
is just a way to unpack an object (!), but the other likelihood is to just
    import Id_whatever from "./file"; => this nests the identifiers vertically, inside the namespace created by an identifier (!); it's like an escape sequence,
given by the interpreter, more so than an "alphabet apparent" thing

(*): "every file is a module"; then modules are just the JSON variant of files, making them uniformly code-accessible (!)
    (!!): but notice that it still doesn't mean that code writing can be done at run-time, or is something encouraged by this javascript mechanism

----
(!): reading files and building .exports objects are the result of an interpretation starting at one point: the index.js
    so, the "tree" begins with index.js as its root
    (*?): but, can it really not evaluate things concurrently: parallel (?!)

----
when one imports/requires codes, it actually "invoke" it (interpret and evaluate it actually); thus, if it has expression with side-effects or "executions",
    they will execute or have side-effects (!)
